==================================
The ``text_indentation`` function
==================================

Using ``text_indentation``
---------------------------

This is an example text file in reStructuredText format. First import
``text_indentation`` from the ``text_indentation_module`` module:

    >>> from text_indentation_module import text_indentation

Now use it to print the text with indentation:

    >>> text_indentation("Hello. How are you? I am fine: Thanks for asking.")
    Hello.

    How are you?

    I am fine:

    Thanks for asking.

Printing a text without special characters:

    >>> text_indentation("This is a string with no special characters")
    This is a string with no special characters

Printing a text with multiple special characters:

    >>> text_indentation("This: is a string. with multiple. special characters?:")
    This:

    is a string.

    with multiple.

    special characters?:

Attempting to pass a non-string argument (Error Case):

    >>> text_indentation(123)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: text must be a string

The ``text_indentation`` function prints the text with two new lines after each of these characters: '.', '?', and ':'.
