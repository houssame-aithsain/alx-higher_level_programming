Task 0: Print a list of integers

    File: 0-print_list_integer.py
    Description: This function prints all the integers in a given list, one integer per line. It uses the str.format() method to print the integers.

Task 1: Secure access to an element in a list

    File: 1-element_at.py
    Description: This function retrieves an element from a list by index. If the index is negative or out of range, it returns None.

Task 2: Replace element

    File: 2-replace_in_list.py
    Description: This function replaces an element in a list at a specific position (index). If the index is negative or out of range, it does not modify the list and returns the original list.

Task 3: Print a list of integers... in reverse!

    File: 3-print_reversed_list_integer.py
    Description: This function prints all the integers of a list in reverse order, one integer per line. It uses the str.format() method to print the integers.

Task 4: Replace in a copy

    File: 4-new_in_list.py
    Description: This function replaces an element in a list at a specific position (index) without modifying the original list. If the index is negative or out of range, it returns a copy of the original list.

Task 5: Can you C me now?

    File: 5-no_c.py
    Description: This function removes all occurrences of the characters 'c' and 'C' from a given string and returns the new string.

Task 6: Lists of lists = Matrix

    File: 6-print_matrix_integer.py
    Description: This function prints a matrix (list of lists) of integers in a specified format. It uses the str.format() method to print the integers.

Task 7: Tuples addition

    File: 7-add_tuple.py
    Description: This function adds two tuples element-wise and returns a new tuple with the results. If a tuple is smaller than 2 elements, it pads with zeros. If a tuple is larger than 2 elements, it considers only the first 2 elements.

Task 8: More returns!

    File: 8-multiple_returns.py
    Description: This function returns a tuple containing the length of a string and its first character. If the string is empty, the first character is None.

Task 9: Find the max

    File: 9-max_integer.py
    Description: This function finds and returns the maximum integer from a list of integers. If the list is empty, it returns None.

Task 10: Only by 2

    File: 10-divisible_by_2.py
    Description: This function checks if each element in a list is divisible by 2 and returns a new list of True or False values accordingly.

Task 11: Delete at

    File: 11-delete_at.py
    Description: This function deletes an element from a list at a specific position (index). If the index is negative or out of range, it does not modify the list and returns the original list.

Task 13: Linked list palindrome

    Files: 13-is_palindrome.c, lists.h
    Description: This C program defines a function is_palindrome that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome. It returns 1 if it's a palindrome and 0 if it's not. An empty list is considered a palindrome.

These tasks cover a range of programming concepts and challenges in both Python and C.
