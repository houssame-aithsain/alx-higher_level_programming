Python More Data Structures

This repository contains Python programs that demonstrate various operations and manipulations on data structures. Each program is contained in its own file, and here's a brief overview of each program:
0. Squared Simple (0-square_matrix_simple.py)

This program defines a function square_matrix_simple(matrix) that computes the square value of all integers in a given 2D matrix. It returns a new matrix of the same size with squared values. The initial matrix is not modified.
1. Search and Replace (1-search_replace.py)

This program defines a function search_replace(my_list, search, replace) that replaces all occurrences of a specified element search with another element replace in a new list. The original list my_list is not modified.
2. Unique Addition (2-uniq_add.py)

This program defines a function uniq_add(my_list) that calculates the sum of all unique integers in a given list. It returns the sum of unique integers.
3. Present in Both (3-common_elements.py)

This program defines a function common_elements(set_1, set_2) that returns a set containing the common elements between two input sets, set_1 and set_2.
4. Only Differents (4-only_diff_elements.py)

This program defines a function only_diff_elements(set_1, set_2) that returns a set containing all elements that are present in only one of the input sets, set_1 or set_2.
5. Number of Keys (5-number_keys.py)

This program defines a function number_keys(a_dictionary) that returns the number of keys in a given dictionary.
6. Print Sorted Dictionary (6-print_sorted_dictionary.py)

This program defines a function print_sorted_dictionary(a_dictionary) that prints the keys and values of a dictionary in ascending order of the keys. It assumes that all keys are strings.
7. Update Dictionary (7-update_dictionary.py)

This program defines a function update_dictionary(a_dictionary, key, value) that updates a dictionary by either adding a new key-value pair or replacing the value of an existing key.
8. Simple Delete by Key (8-simple_delete.py)

This program defines a function simple_delete(a_dictionary, key="") that deletes a key from a dictionary if it exists. The dictionary is not modified if the key is not present.
9. Multiply by 2 (9-multiply_by_2.py)

This program defines a function multiply_by_2(a_dictionary) that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.
10. Best Score (10-best_score.py)

This program defines a function best_score(a_dictionary) that returns the key with the highest integer value in a dictionary. If no score is found, it returns None.
11. Multiply by Using Map (11-multiply_list_map.py)

This program defines a function multiply_list_map(my_list=[], number=0) that returns a new list with all values multiplied by a specified number without using loops. It uses the map function.
12. Roman to Integer (12-roman_to_int.py)

This program defines a function roman_to_int(roman_string) that converts a Roman numeral to an integer. It can handle Roman numerals between 1 and 3999. If the input is not a string or None, it returns 0.

Each program file contains a description of its functionality and examples of usage.
